        <p class="_lede">I have worked in the "web industry" since around 2000, starting off as a digital producer for a scientific publishing house in London. Along the way Iâ€™ve worked for various agencies as a permanent member of staff or a contractor in dev teams, as a designer and occasionally in management. I've made tons of cool stuff with cutting-edge technologies like WML, Flash and ColdFusion. :)</p>
